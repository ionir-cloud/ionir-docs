### Collecting Ionir Logs and Statistics

Ionir logs and statistics can be collected using the Ionir UI.

![](../.gitbook/assets/logs.png)

Open the Ionir Cloud Manager Operations and click the download cluster diagnostics icon next to the cluster. Here you can select the Time Interval for collection (Last 2-48hrs) and logs/metrics options and click “DOWNLOAD”. This will start the collector jobs that will aggregate all information and download it as a zip file to the computer using the browser.

You must keep the browser running until the collection process completes and the file is downloaded.
