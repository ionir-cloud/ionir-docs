# Kubernetes Support

### Upstream Kubernetes

The Kubernetes project [maintains release](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) branches for the most recent three minor releases (1.23, 1.22, 1.21) as of February 2022. Kubernetes 1.19 and newer receive approximately 1 year of patch support. Ionir follows this release lifecycle and supports the latest versions on the day of GA.

Ionir version 2.6 officially supports Kubernetes 1.19 to 1.21 and will continue to support in this pattern (GA-1 to GA-3 included). Other (mostly later) releases will be reviewed and supported per request.

### Red Hat Open Container Platform (OCP)

Ionir support for OCP is through an Operator which will be installed and controls the entire lifecycle of Ionir data platform.&#x20;

Ionir version 2.6 supports OCP 4.6.x and up to 4.9.x

RHCOS as worker nodes OS (for RHEL support contact [support@ionir.com](mailto:support@ionir.com))
