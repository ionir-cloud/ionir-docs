# Prerequisites

Ionir requires a set of resources and Worker Nodes configuration to be deployed successfully on a Kubernetes Cluster. This chapter lists all these requirements and more.

To be sure all prerequisites are met, Ionir has developed the "[Ionir Compatibility Tool](../ionir-compatability-tool.md)", which scans your Kubernetes environments and makes sure all requirements are met.
